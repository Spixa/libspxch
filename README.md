# libspxch
This is the library version of [Spixa-Command-Handler](https://github.com/Spixa/CommandHandler-OpenSource) that handles commands and arguments. This library allows you to load a command list from a file and be able to compile and add it to your project as a command with a collection of strings as argument sheet. You can use and manage your command afterwards as you wish.
## How to port libspxch to your project
